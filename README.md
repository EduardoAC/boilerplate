# Boilerplate

This PWA boilerplate will contain the minimal setup using the minimal set of technologies so 
we can clone the repository and start delivering without need to setup everything constantly. 

**Note**: This project doesn't pretend to replace any existing solution like create-react-app but help provide me a 
field to get a better understanding on the current technologies.

## Technology Stack

Base setup: 
- Language: TypeScript, 
- Package Manager: yarn
- Bundle: Webpack 4
- UI: React
